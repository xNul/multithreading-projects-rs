# What is this?

A repository for my Rust assignments in COP 6616 Multicore class.

# Building and Running an Assignment

To build an assignment listed in this repository, the command `cargo build --release -p <assignment>` can be used with Rust and the Cargo package manager.

The executable will then be found under `target/release/<assignment>`.

To run an assignment without building, the command `cargo run --release -p <assignment>` can be used.
